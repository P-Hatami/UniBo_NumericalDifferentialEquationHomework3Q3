# UniBo_NumericalDifferentialEquationHomework3Q3
MATLAB script for Convergence Analysis of a 2D Elliptic PDE Solver. Compares numerical results against an analytical exact solution using L2-norm error metrics across multiple grid resolutions. Validates the second-order accuracy of the Finite Difference Scheme and ensures numerical consistency for complex source terms.
